The original concept came from the name of low-poly, colorful triangles using canvas while a color only appears once. This is a concept very achievable if only drawing inside of the area of the triangle pixel by pixel using canvas wasn't so hard. Rather than filling multiple pixels in an area with 1 color which canvas gracefully handles. Admittedly, trigonometry is not my best suit, and even had to fail in high school, take remedial classes and graduate. And EVEN having to work in a game dev firm where I was spoonfeed hard math which I was grateful for (thanks to my manager, Dennis!).
